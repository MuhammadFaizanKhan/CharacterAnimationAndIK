# Unity Character Animation Examples

Explore character animation techniques in Unity with these two detailed examples: Character Movement on Path and Character IK (Inverse Kinematics) Demo. This project showcases how to use Mixamo animations and Unity's powerful animation tools to create realistic character movements.

## Character Movement on Path

**Scene Location**: `Assets/Scenes/Animation_CharacterMovementOnPath`

This scene demonstrates how a character can walk along a predefined path. The example shows the character's smooth and natural movement, following a path designed within Unity. This setup is ideal for games or simulations where characters need to navigate specific routes.

- **Key Features**:
  - Character follows a predefined path with precision.
  - Mixamo animations are used for realistic walking motions.
  - Easily customizable for different path designs.

## Character IK (Inverse Kinematics) Demo

**Scene Location**: `Assets/Scenes/AnimationIK_HeadExample`

In this scene, you can observe how Inverse Kinematics (IK) is applied to a character's head to track the movement of a ball. The demo also allows you to set up other body parts to rotate and follow the ball, showcasing Unity's robust IK system.

- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time head tracking using IK.
  - Ability to extend IK to other body parts (e.g., arms, legs).
  - Demonstrates the integration of Mixamo animations with Unityâ€™s IK system.

## Character Animations from Mixamo

A variety of character animations are stored in the `Animations` folder. These animations have been sourced from [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) and are fully compatible with Unity. You can easily apply these animations to different characters in your projects.

- **Animations include**:
  - Walking
  - Idle
  - Left turn
  - Right Turn
  - Pointing
  - Picking
  - Sitting
  - And more...

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MuhammadFaizanKhan/CharacterAnimationAndIK.git`
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Navigate to the `Scenes` folder and open the scene you'd like to explore.

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3.23 or later (It will run easily on older unity as well but not tested)                    
  
- [Mixamo account](https://www.mixamo.com/) for additional animations
